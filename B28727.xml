            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> Humbly Offered against Reducing the Duty of <hi>Low Wines</hi> from <hi>Foreign Materials.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Act of the Second of his Present Majesty's Reign for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tillage, laid a Duty of 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon on all Low Wines from Foreign Materials, and but 1 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon on Low Wines from Corn. This great Difference in that Duty encouraged several Persons to erect Distilling-Houses; and were at great Cost and Charges to Distil from Malted Corn only.</p>
            <p>The Reducing the Duty of Foreign Materials to 4 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon, and keeping up the Duty of 1 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon upon Low Wines from Corn, will have the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Effects upon the Nation in general, as well as upon the Malt Distiller in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Malt Distillers must lose the Benefit of all those Utensils which they erected and prepared for Distilling Corn, and Distil Molossus, or else not work till there is such a difference between the Price of Malt and Foreign Materials, as the Reduction of 4 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon on the Low Wines will amount to. For as the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at present is, there is but 6 <hi>l. per</hi> Tun difference in the Price of Spirit. And if 4 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon is taken off the Low Wines, that will be 8 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun; which will make Molossus Spirit cheaper than Corn; and then no Man can Distil from Corn; and how much that will be to the Interest of the Landed Men of <hi>England,</hi> is left to them to judge. For it is evident, that nothing but the Difference in the Duty, can give Encouragement to Distil from Malt; which was the Opinion of those who made that Act for the Good of the Country. And whatever Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they were that inclined the Parliament to make such a Difference in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are still in force: For the Country ought now to be as much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as ever: And if this Act pass, it will be as certain a Prohibition of Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Corn, as if the late Act, which allowed an half Quantity, had forbid the Use of any at all.</p>
            <p>The Plantations will not receive any great Benefit neither: For the Reducing the Duty of Low Wines from all Foreign Materials, will give a Liberty for Men to Distil from Wines, Lees, Figs, Raisins, Currans: And there is a long <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Men will prefer even to Sugar and Molossus. For the Distiller once prohibited the use of Malt, has no other Inconvenience than the first loss of his Brewing Vessels, and then can Distil from other Materials as well as any, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will take to the more Profitable. Therefore, for the Good of <hi>England</hi> in general, and to preserve our selves from the Disadvantage of a Trade in <hi>French</hi> Brandy, it is humbly Proposed, That</p>
            <list>
               <item>The present Duty on <hi>French</hi> Brandy be kept up.</item>
               <item>That all Low Wines from Foreign Materials, not of the Growth of our Colonies, be 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon.</item>
               <item>That all Low Wines from Materials of the Growth of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, be 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon.</item>
               <item>That all Low Wines from <hi>English</hi> Materials be free from Duty of Excise.</item>
